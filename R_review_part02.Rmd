This review is based on the book: https://r4ds.hadley.nz/

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Basics

Basic calculations
```{r}
1 / 200 *30
(59 + 73 + 2) / 3
sin(pi / 2)
```

Create new objects with assignment operator
```{r}
x <- 3 * 4
# or
y = 4 * 5
print(x)
print(y)
```

Combine multiple items into a vector
```{r}
primes = c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13)
print(primes)
```

Basic arithmetic on vector is applied element-wise
```{r}
primes * 2
primes - 1
```
